# Summary of Differences: Lexers vs Parsers

| Feature                | Lexer (Lexical Analyzer)                          | Parser (Syntax Analyzer)                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**           | Converts a sequence of characters into tokens.  | Analyzes tokens to determine grammatical structure. |
| **Input**             | Raw source code (text).                          | Tokens produced by the lexer.                     |
| **Output**            | Stream of tokens.                                | Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) or parse tree.       |
| **Functionality**     | Identifies keywords, operators, identifiers, etc.| Validates syntax and constructs a hierarchical representation. |
| **Error Handling**     | Detects lexical errors (e.g., invalid characters). | Detects syntax errors (e.g., incorrect structure). |
| **Complexity**        | Generally simpler and faster.                    | More complex due to grammar rules and structures. |
| **Tools**             | Often implemented using tools like Lex or Flex. | Often implemented using tools like Yacc or Bison. |
| **Level of Abstraction** | Low-level (character and token level).        | High-level (structural and semantic level).      |

## Conclusion

Lexers and parsers are both essential components of a compiler or interpreter, serving distinct roles in the process of translating source code into executable form. The lexer focuses on breaking down the input into manageable tokens, while the parser organizes these tokens into a meaningful structure based on grammatical rules.
