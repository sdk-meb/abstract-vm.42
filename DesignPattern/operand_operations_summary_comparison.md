# Summary: Operand Operations, Memory Optimization, and Trade-Offs between Three Approaches

## Approaches:
1. **Factory Pattern:** 
   - Dynamically create operands using a factory based on the result type (determined by operand precision and the operation).
   
2. **Using `double` for Every Operation:**
   - Always use `Operand<double>` to handle all operations, ensuring no overflow but at the cost of excessive memory allocation.

3. **Optimal Storage with `determineResultType`:**
   - Dynamically select the smallest operand type that fits the result of the operation. This minimizes memory usage but requires more logic to calculate the correct type.

## Trade-Off Between Simplicity and Efficiency:

### **1. Factory Pattern**
- **Simplicity:** 
  - The Factory provides a clean, abstracted method to create operands based on the result type, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.
  - It simplifies operand creation but may add a slight overhead compared to directly instantiating the correct operand type.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The Factory pattern does not inherently introduce significant performance issues but might involve a slight overhead when compared to direct operand instantiation.
  - The Factory helps ensure that the correct operand type is created dynamically based on the result type without over-allocating memory (e.g., creating `Int8` when the result fits, not `double`).

### **2. Using `double` for Every Operation**
- **Simplicity:**
  - This approach is the simplest to implement because it avoids complex logic to decide the correct operand type. Every operation result is always stored as a `double`.
  - However, this simplicity comes at the cost of performance and memory.

- **Efficiency:**
  - Using `double` for all operations is highly inefficient, particularly for integer operations or small result types.
  - It leads to unnecessary memory allocation (e.g., using a `double` when a smaller type like `int8_t` would suffice).
  - This approach does not optimize for memory use and can introduce **unneeded precision** overhead.

### **3. Using `determineResultType` for Optimal Storage**
- **Simplicity:**
  - This approach is more complex because it requires logic to determine the exact result type based on operand precision and the operation performed.
  - The `determineResultType` method calculates the required storage type dynamically based on the result, adding more complexity compared to the Factory or `double` approach.

- **Efficiency:**
  - This is the most **memory-efficient** approach, as it ensures that the smallest possible type is used to store the result of the operation, avoiding the overhead of `double`.
  - By carefully selecting the result type (e.g., `Int8`, `Int32`, `Float`), memory allocation is minimized without sacrificing precision.
  - It can introduce computational complexity because of the need to dynamically calculate and allocate the correct type.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Each Approach:

| Approach                | Simplicity                                | Efficiency                                      | Trade-Off                                             |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Factory Pattern**      | Easy to extend and maintain, centralizes operand creation | Slight overhead in dynamic creation but ensures correct type allocation | Balances memory use and maintainability without excess overhead |
| **Using `double` for Every Operation** | Extremely simple to implement | Highly inefficient, uses more memory than necessary | Best for simplicity but worst for memory optimization |
| **`determineResultType` for Optimal Storage** | Most complex approach | Most efficient in terms of memory usage | Requires careful handling but ensures optimal type selection |

## Conclusion:
- **Factory Pattern** is a good middle ground, offering flexibility, maintainability, and efficiency without introducing significant performance costs.
- **Using `double` for every operation** is simple but inefficient and should be avoided for operations that don't require such precision.
- **`determineResultType`** is the most memory-efficient but comes with additional complexity, making it ideal for cases where precision and memory optimization are critical.
